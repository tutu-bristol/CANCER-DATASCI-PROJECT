# Architecture of a Deep Neural Network for cancer detection in histopathologic scans of lymph node sections

This repository contains my code contributed to a group data science project involving the use of the biggest dataset of cancer image scans to train an AI algorithm (Deep Neural Network) to predict a negative or positive cancer diagnosis. 

**Model: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

**Task: binary classification**

**Dataset: - PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset (learn more: https://github.com/tutu-bristol/pcam)**
